here's a story for you:\n\nIn the heart of Compton, there was a little record store named \"Rhythm & Roots.\" It sat on the corner of a bustling street, nestled between a barber shop and a taco stand. The store was a haven for music lovers, with walls adorned with posters of legendary artists and rows of vinyl records that reflected the diversity of the neighborhood's rich musical history.\n\nThe store was run by Mr. Jenkins, a curmudgeonly but kind-hearted man in his sixties. He had seen the neighborhood change over decades, and his store had become a refuge for kids looking to escape the realities outside—a place where they could dream of a future painted with melodies rather than sirens.\n\nOne kid who frequented the shop was a 15-year-old named Jamal. Quiet and observant, he was always digging through crates of records, his fingers tracing the grooves as if trying to understand the stories within them. Jamal's father had been a musician, a trumpet player who used to play jazz on weekends. But he had passed away when Jamal was just a toddler, leaving behind only a collection of records and a passion for music.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, as Jamal was browsing through the store, Mr. Jenkins noticed him lingering over a particular section—the records of old jazz legends. He approached Jamal and placed a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"You got an ear for the classics, I see,\" Mr. Jenkins said, his voice gravelly but warm. \"You ever think about playing music yourself?\"\n\nJamal shrugged. \"I dunno. I mean, I like listening, but… I never tried.\"\n\nMr. Jenkins nodded thoughtfully and grinned as if he had an idea. \"Tell you what, son. I got an old trumpet in the back. Needs some love, but it's got a good tone—just like your old man's. Why don't you take it home, see what it tells you?\"\n\nJamal's eyes widened. \"You serious?\"\n\n\"As serious as a Miles Davis solo,\" Mr. Jenkins chuckled.\n\nSo, Jamal took the trumpet home, spending hours learning how to coax notes from its tarnished brass bell. At first, the sounds were raw and rough, but with determination, they began to transform into something soulful, something alive.\n\nAs weeks turned into months, Jamal's confidence grew. He would occasionally play for Mr. Jenkins, jamming along with the records in the store, his notes weaving in with the tunes of the past. The neighborhood started taking notice. People would gather outside, drawn by the sound of jazz spilling out onto the sidewalk, warming the cool evening air.\n\nJamal was creating a bridge between the past and present, and through his music, he found a way to express his story, his pain, and his dreams.\n\nYears later, Jamal would remember that rainy afternoon at Rhythm & Roots as the moment that changed his life. He went on to perform in clubs and even released his own records, becoming a beloved figure in the community, much like his father before him.\n\nAnd through it all, that little record store on the corner remained—a testament to the power of music, where dreams could be sparked by a simple act of kindness and a dusty old trumpet."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Explanation:\n","\n","* **System Prompt**: Sets the context or persona for the assistant.\n","* **User Prompt**: Specifies the task or question.\n","* **Messages**: A list of interactions leading up to the current request.\n","* **Model**: The AI model used for generating the response."],"metadata":{"id":"9rjpWHcknV4D"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Text Generation With Parameters\n","\n","We can influence the creativity and randomness of the generated text by adjusting parameters like temperature and top_p"],"metadata":{"id":"8j2jhr1Qm7zV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Generate text with adjusted parameters\n","response = client.chat.completions.create(\n","    model=MODEL,\n","    messages=[\n","        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt2},\n","        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_prompt},\n","    ],\n","    temperature=1.2,\n","    top_p=1.0,\n","    presence_penalty=0.0,\n","    frequency_penalty=0,\n",")\n","\n","# Display the output\n","display(Markdown(response.choices[0].message.content))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":442},"id":"VXXNb2dtnTPD","outputId":"d502224a-13ea-45a4-cd26-26800cfc38e4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757247897851,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":12026,"user":{"displayName":"Joy Odinaka","userId":"16292979530067323765"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and whispering forests, there lived a young girl named Elara. With hair the color of chestnuts and eyes that sparkled like stars, she was known far and wide for her insatiable curiosity about the world around her. \n\nEach dawn, Elara would wander the meadows, collecting stories from the gentle stream that sung a different melody every morning, or the old oak that stood as the village's guardian, weaving its woven wisdom into the rustling leaves.\n\nOne day, as the sun dipped behind the horizon, Elara ventured beyond the familiar paths to explore the forbidden grove the villagers whispered about. It was said to be a place of ancient magic, a place where time stood still and every shadow told secrets.\n\nThere, amidst the twilight mist, she stumbled upon a peculiar book resting atop a moss-covered stone. Its pages were aglow with a soft luminescence, enticing her to open it. As she traced her fingers across the aged parchment, the words seemed to float gently upwards like tendrils of smoke, evoking images of splendid realms and mysterious creatures in her mind.\n\nCuriosity piqued, Elara spent many an eve in that grove, learning from the enchanted book. It spoke of lost worlds and untold mysteries, of courage and endless adventure. With each turn of the page, Elara unleashed more magic into the air, brightening the village's folklore as she recounted tales never heard before.\n\nBut soon, Elara realized that with great stories came great responsibilities. The magic she unlocked began to seep beyond the whispering grove, enchanting villagers with visions of grandeur yet unknown. Flowers bloomed in hues unseen, rivers sang an old ballad, and every heart yearned for a world that lay on the watercolor lines of reality.\n\nElara understood that magic, though beautiful, could equally be elusive and all-consuming. Balancing dream with duty, she whispered an ancient phrase picked from a forgotten line in her enchanted book and returned the book to the forest stone, realizing it belonged with the world's mysteries.\n\nWith this balance restored, the village continued to bask in the quiet wonder Elara had stirred—where imagination and realness convivially danced to nature's tunes. In heart and hearth, Elara knew deeply, stories, like life, were meant to be forged wisely and shared freely.\n\nFrom that day on, Elara became not just a bearer of tales but a guardian of harmony. Her journeys through pages taught her that wondrous sight could inspire, but only grounded light would truly illuminate the path deeply desired. And so her own story became a reminder that all things Captivating, within the infinites of imagination or time, begin and abide by listening... responding, first to one beautiful question – what stories stemmed simply from being sincerely alive?"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Key Concepts:\n","\n","* **Temperature:** This parameter controls the randomness of the model's output.
