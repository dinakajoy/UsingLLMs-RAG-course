My name is Ozinaka Joy. I'm a back-end AV developer with over four years of experience building web applications for startups and open source organizations. I specialize in TypeScript and Node.js, working with tools like Next.js and Express.js to build reliable and scalable systems that are user-focused based on empathy. Over the years, I've also contributed to open source projects, methoded other developers, and spoken at some tech events. Beyond JavaScript, I have worked with OCaml through open source contributions and internships, and I'm building my knowledge of Python as I dive deeper into artificial intelligence. So far, so good. I've been focused on natural language processing and large language models, and I've got to work with tools like LangChain, Clue.ai, and HoganFace. Some of my recent projects bring web and AI together, such as Job Application Assistance, which is an app that helps users to match job descriptions to their resume, and also generate cover letters. The second one is SoSync, which is a mental health app that helps users to sync daily, and it also integrates a machine learning model that helps users predict if they need mental health treatment. Number three is Face Detection App, where I consume Qualifier's API to detect faces on images. And recently, I built DocsQuery, which is a QAddy system on private data using LangChain and HoganFace. Each of these projects is focused on solving real-world problems through the combination of back-end engineering and AI. My goal is to combine strong back-end engineering with AI to build smarter and more impactful solutions across JavaScript, OCaml, and Python ecosystems. So if you're looking for a developer who brings both technical depth and a passion for innovation, I would love to connect. Feel free to explore my projects below. I'll do my best to reach out. Thank you for watching.
